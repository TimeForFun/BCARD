This fork is only to provide the old exe to unlock your wallet!

Steps:
1) Rename your CARDbuyers folder in appdata
2) Download the old .exe
3) Create a new folder in appdata called CARDbuyers
4) COPY, DO NOT MOVE, your old wallet.dat file to the new CARDbuyers directory. In otherwords, keep a virgin backup of your old wallet!
5) Run old .exe
6) You should be able to use the wallet commands to change password.

if anyone else is interested you can change passphrase in the debug console using the following format
walletpassphrasechange oldpassphrase newpassphrase

7) If it worked, you will be able to read your accounts and balances.
8) Now you can send for swap.
9) Don't delete the wallet until you have the new coins in the new wallet.
10) Send me a thumbs up in discord!
